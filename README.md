This repository contains a port of Apple's new
[Device Hub](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/managing-your-simulated-and-physical-devices-in-device-hub)
app included with Xcode 27, built to run on iOS and iPadOS.

Device Hub pairs with a compatible Apple device, displays its screen, and
controls it from another iPhone or iPad. The implementation builds on the
open-source [`idevice`](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice) protocol stack and
uses private, undocumented Apple interfaces.

## Features

- Discover, pair, and reconnect to compatible devices on the local network.
- View a clean initial screenshot followed by a live HEVC display stream.
- Send taps, drags, and keyboard input.
- Use Home, Lock, Rotate, Siri, mute, and volume controls.
- Preserve controller identity and pairing records securely in Keychain.
- Adapt the remote experience across iPhone, iPad, portrait, landscape, and
  narrow iPad windows.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode 27 and the iOS 27 SDK
- An iPhone or iPad running iOS or iPadOS 27
- A compatible target device with Developer Mode enabled
- An Apple development signing identity for device installation
- Local-network connectivity between the controller and target

Device Hub iOS is currently verified against the Beta 3 train of iOS 27 and
iPadOS 27. Later seeds may require protocol updates.

## Getting started

The Xcode project is generated with
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen). Development tools and common
workflows are managed by [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mh-mobile/device-hub-ios-agent.git
cd device-hub-ios-agent
mise trust
mise install
mise run setup
mise run build
```

The default build is unsigned. For a signed device build, copy
`Config/Local.xcconfig.example` to `Config/Local.xcconfig`, then set
`DEVICE_HUB_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` and `DEVICE_HUB_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` for your
Apple Developer account. `Local.xcconfig` is gitignored;
`Config/Project.xcconfig` contains the portable project defaults.

Available tasks:

| Task | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mise run setup` | Prepare dependencies and generated build inputs |
| `mise run generate` | Regenerate the Xcode project |
| `mise run build` | Build the app for development |
| `mise run test` | Run the test suites |
| `mise run lint` | Run formatting, lint, and static-analysis checks |
| `mise run previews` | Render the visual review matrix |
| `mise run snapshots:record` | Regenerate and verify iOS visual snapshots |
| `mise run archive` | Create an app archive with local signing settings |
| `mise run ci` | Run the appropriate local verification suite for the current changes |

Run `mise tasks` for the full task list.

## Agent HTTP API

This fork can let an agent on another machine drive the device shown in Device
Hub over HTTP on port 8765 (`/screen`, `/screenshot`, `/tap`, `/drag`, `/type`,
`/button`). It is off by default. To enable it, set a token of at least 16
characters in `Config/Local.xcconfig`:

```
DEVICE_HUB_AGENT_TOKEN = <output of: openssl rand -hex 24>
```

Requests must come from loopback or a Tailscale address (100.64.0.0/10,
fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48) and send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Connections from
other sources are closed without a response, and missing or wrong tokens get 401. `Tools/agent-mcp/device_hub_mcp.py` is a
stdio MCP server for it; it requires `DEVICE_HUB_URL` (the iPad's full tailnet
name) and `DEVICE_HUB_AGENT_TOKEN`, ignores proxy settings, and does not follow
redirects, so the token reaches only that URL.

Two limits to keep in mind:

- 100.64.0.0/10 is also the carrier-grade NAT range. On a network that uses it
  internally, its devices pass the source check, and only the token protects
  the API.
- The token is built into the app's Info.plist in plain text. Anyone with the
  built app can read it, so never set it in a build you give to others.

Swift owns the app lifecycle, interface, Bonjour discovery, endpoint
validation, Keychain persistence, feature state, and decoded-frame delivery.
Rust owns pairing, authenticated tunnels, Remote Service Discovery, CoreDevice
services, display transport, and HID input.

  provides explicit feature state, actions, effects, and cancellation.
- [Swift Dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies)
  provides controlled live and test dependencies.
- [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing),
  [Custom Dump](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-custom-dump), and
